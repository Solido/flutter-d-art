# Generative d.Art

Demonstrate how to generate your very own [#d_Art](https://twitter.com/hashtag/d_Art) using Flutter.
As a technical point we are NOT relying on Widget but RenderBox directly.

Don't be afraid of those 60 lines of codes & change everything you want
(but not the line with Math.Exp, it can damage your computer permanently)

Code is tuned to work on a << TABLET SCREEN SIZE >> so start an equivalent
not a phone.

Can't wait to see your Creations on Twitter
Post with [#d_Art](https://twitter.com/hashtag/d_Art) so everyone can appreciate it !

## Final Result
